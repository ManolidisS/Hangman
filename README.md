# Hangman
A few months ago I tried doing a hangman project in python, and I miserably failed.
I thought I'd give it another go, and somehow, miraculously, I did it in about an hour and a half over two days.
This code is licensed under the MIT license. (Although it's very simple)
I don't think anyone would use this commerically, you're free to do so however.
I just want this on my portfolio/to help anyone who is struggling, they can see my code.
Hope this helps!
